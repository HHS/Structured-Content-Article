<h1>Health and Human Services (HHS) Drupal Content Type Library: Article</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Article content type is the most basic content type and should be used for content that does not need a specific structure attached to it. Article pages can be composed of simple text or other content types and elements. Tiles and customized views pulling specific fields from other content types can be added as well.

<h2>Content Type Details</h2>
Contained in the /documentation folder are the content model for Article content type (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-Article.xlsx) which includes the Drupal field names used and their matching schema.org metadata name; and a Word Template (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-Template-Article.docx), which is a guidance document we provide to content owners to complete whenever they want an Article to be created. The Template includes all of the fields that must be completed in order to create the Article, as well as a taxonomy list to reference as they fill in those fields that require a taxonomy term. 

<h2>Drupal Features Module</h2>
This module is generated using Features module. It packages fields and variables together into one module, which can be installed like any other Drupal module.
